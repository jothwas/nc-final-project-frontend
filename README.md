# Scran Plan

This project looks to make choosing meals for the week and shopping easier in your household. 

As a parent user of the app you will have final say in what meals get cooked on what days, but this app will hopefully get the rest of your household involved by voting for meals.

It will also provide you with a shopping list based on your choices - so you know exactly what ingredients are needed for the week!
